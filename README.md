- Conditions on phone No
- Otp screen with verifying by phone no
- Shared Prefrences(Stroring token in local storage to avoid sending otp again.)
- HomeScreen
- Premium products Api
- Jobs section
- Used APIs Wherever possible (Avoided hardcoding information obtainable from APIs)

### Features Not Implemented with Reasons
- Available premium products as I do not have those produxts so I wasnt getting data for it hence unable to get structure so avoided UI too.
- State Managers: Would have definitely implemented Bloc for production or at least Provider, but opted for basic set state due to the assignment's simplicity.
- Sorting: Considered it, but deemed it lengthy for the assignment's purpose.
- Searching: Deemed excessive for the assignment's scope.
